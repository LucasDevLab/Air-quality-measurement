Hello, to build the air quality measuring device you need:
- 1 arduino card
- 1 LCD screen
- 1 buzzer
- 1 Breadboard
- Some connection cable
- 1 MQ135 module
- 3 resistors (150Ω and 180Ω)
- 3 LEDs (green, yellow, red)

In the "Air_Quality_Motitor.ino" file you will find the code to put in the Arduino IDE.

In the "plan.png" file you will find the installation diagram of the air quality measuring device.


/!\ Depending on the sensitivity threshold of your MQ135 module, the value may vary! You can change the values ​​of lines #34 and #43.

/!\ If an error you have a problem with your LCD screens you must modify line n°3! To find the code for your LCD screen, enter this code () into the Arduino and it will display your code (for example: 0x3F,16,2)
